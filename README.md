# Smart Gate System

**Smart Gate System** is an IoT‚Äêbased project designed to control and monitor a gate using an **ESP8266 (NodeMCU)**. It integrates:

- **RFID** for authorized access  
- **Physical buttons** for manual control  
- **Blynk app** for remote control and status  
- **WhatsApp alerts** via CallMeBot for unauthorized attempts

## üîë Features

- **RFID Access Control**  
  Opens the gate only for authorized cards.  
- **Manual Control**  
  Push‚Äëbuttons for local open/close.  
- **Mobile Control**  
  Blynk app widgets to open/close and display gate status.  
- **WhatsApp Alerts**
